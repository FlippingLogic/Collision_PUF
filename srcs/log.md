## 7.24: Update FSM & Data Remaining Time Test

Chaotic Sequential FSM

State Updated FSM: w_doutb continuous detection

### Problem Unsolved
- Not prefect random
- 1.5 cycle behavior doesn't match: neg edge stableï¼Œpos edge random
- ILA influence FSM: Cause chaotic sequential

### TO DO
- [ ] Change Bram ADDR
- [x] Keep write enable, change dina

## 7.25: Bram Behavior Analysis - Keep Prot A always write enable

Register written on Positive Edge

Register written on Negative Edge

### Potential Problem
- Global_clk and ILA_clk just satisfy **sample principle**. (Robustness? Data Correctness?)
- **Model robustness is weak**, random data can occur or disappear just by small change (like ILA wiring).

### Discovery
- **Register** can also produce random data
- Timing:
    - BRAM: 1-1.5cycle to produce random data
    - Reg: 1.5 Cycle to read random data
- Single bit can jump repeatedly
- Data robustness
    - Keep power, immediate repeat: small change (temperature: around 31.8 degrees)
    - Cut off power, 5-min repeat:
    - Keep power, 5-min repeat: significant change (temperature: around 32.8 degrees)

### Ideas for next step
- Try register TRNG/PUF
- Clone project to Pango Evaluation Board
- Get mutiple data and analyze (test ECC code, etc.)
